The following is from the EPL 2021-2022 season. The hold (~5%) comes almost entirely from draws and home teams.

Total games in the dataset:  378
Average draw probability:  0.24134381662484805
Percentage of games drawn:  0.23015873015873015
Average implied probability of a draw:  0.252710286373565

Percentage of games won by away team:  0.3412698412698413
Average implied probability:  0.34254833449493327

Unsurprisingly, amost the entire profit generated was from betting on away teams (at a 15% minimum edge)

This is in stark contrast to where the hold is in La Liga during the same season: almost entirely on the away team
The draw numbers are interesting: historically around 27.5% in La Liga, but the book had a small enough hold on that to lose on variance

Total games in the dataset:  379
Average draw probability:  0.26445774823084384

The model also underpredicted draws, so it missed out on this opportunity:

The model did manage to find this spot in the Bundesliga: there was almost no hold on home teams

Total games in the dataset:  302
Average draw probability:  0.24437977414906048
Percentage of games drawn:  0.23841059602649006
Average implied probability of a draw:  0.2455225472828563

Average home win probability:  0.46165038914070866
Percentage of games won by home team:  0.46357615894039733
Average implied probability:  0.46483759991595885

Average away win probability:  0.2922623838043611
Percentage of games won by away team:  0.2980132450331126
Average implied probability:  0.3433855096853581

Almost every bet is on home teams, and all of the profit comes from those bets:
Total Profit:  5.0200000000000005  on  21  total bets
Profit    6.02

The interesting thing shown by these 3 leagues is how steady the implied probability on home teams is.
The shift occurs between the odds of a draw and the odds of the away team winning.
The book also doesn't seem to take a large hold on draws, although the model doesn't pick up this as a big edge.

Part of this explanation very likely lies in the goalscoring environments presented by each league.
In the following chart, the first number in each column is goals across the entire database, and the second is goals in the test data.
League    Home Goals        Away Goals
Germany   1.645   1.718     1.349   1.43
Spain     1.511   1.48      1.159   1.183
England   1.565   1.621     1.283   1.33

The model seems to performs better in higher goal scoring environments.
In fact, La Liga is the only league of the 3 where the model underpredicted draws.
Fortunately, the general trend is towards higher goal scoring: each league had higher scoring rates in the test set than the sample set.

The Eredivisie is a high scoring league, but the available data is not great. The model missed the massive edge on away teams
