The following is from the EPL 2021-2022 season. The hold (~5%) comes almost entirely from draws and home teams.

Total games in the dataset:  378
Average draw probability:  0.24134381662484805
Percentage of games drawn:  0.23015873015873015
Average implied probability of a draw:  0.252710286373565

Average home win probability:  0.44611870651027136
Percentage of games won by home team:  0.42857142857142855

Average away win probability:  0.3109815874505258
Percentage of games won by away team:  0.3412698412698413
Average implied probability:  0.34254833449493327

Unsurprisingly, amost the entire profit generated was from betting on away teams (at a 15% minimum edge)

This is in stark contrast to where the hold is in La Liga during the same season: almost entirely on the away team
The draw numbers are interesting: historically around 27.5% in La Liga, but the book had a small enough hold on that to lose on variance

Total games in the dataset:  379
Average draw probability:  0.26445774823084384

The model also underpredicted draws, so it missed out on this opportunity:
