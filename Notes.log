The following is from the EPL 2021-2022 season. The hold (~5%) comes almost entirely from draws and home teams.
This is in contrast to the model, which underpredicted home goals by .05 and overpredicted away goals by .11, leading to overpredicting away teams

Percentage of games won by away team:  0.3412698412698413
Average implied probability:  0.34254833449493327

Unsurprisingly, most of the bets were on away teams
In this particular case, the lost value comes largely from bets on heavy away favorites.

This is in stark contrast to where the hold is in La Liga during the same season: almost entirely on the away team
The draw numbers are interesting: historically around 27.5% in La Liga, but the book had a small enough hold on that to lose on variance

The model also underpredicted draws, so it missed out on this opportunity:

The model did manage to find a similar spot in the Bundesliga: there was almost no hold on home teams

Average implied probability:  0.3433855096853581

Almost every bet is on home teams, and most of the profit comes from those bets:

The interesting thing shown by these 3 leagues is how steady the implied probability on home teams is.
The shift occurs between the odds of a draw and the odds of the away team winning.
The book also doesn't seem to take a large hold on draws, although the model doesn't pick this up as a big edge.

Part of this explanation very likely lies in the goalscoring environments presented by each league.
In the following chart, the first number in each column is goals across the entire database, and the second is goals in the test data.
League    Home Goals        Away Goals
Germany   1.645   1.718     1.349   1.43
Spain     1.511   1.48      1.159   1.183
England   1.565   1.621     1.283   1.33

The model seems to performs better in higher goal scoring environments.
In fact, La Liga is the only league of the 3 where the model underpredicted draws.
Fortunately, the general trend is towards higher goal scoring: each league had higher scoring rates in the test set than the sample set.

The Eredivisie is a high scoring league, but the available data is not great. The model did, however, find the massive edge on away teams

This turned into a fantastic return from a group of bets almost entirely on away sides
